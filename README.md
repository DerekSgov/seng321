# About Me

My name is Derek Siemens and I am currently a student at the University of Victoria studying computer science and software engineering. In the context of CS and Seng, my interest include data mining, natural language processing, security and data science. Outside of school, I enjoy creating music, hiking, camping, learning new things and working on projects whenever I have some spare time.

# About This Site

This site is built using [Gatbsy](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), uses React for the front-end and stores its content in small json files. I chose this combination as it creates a fast web application that is very easy to deploy and add content to from a developer standpoint. Additionally, I had gained a significant amount of experience working with this set tools on my most current co-op work term with the BC Government.
